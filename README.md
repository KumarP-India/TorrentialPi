# TorrentialPi
Bittorrent Server on Raspberry Pi with setup of being completely isolated.

## Project Status Update

I have written all of the scripts necessary for the project and provided a detailed setup guide in the Setup.md file. Despite my efforts and multiple attempts (six, to be exact), I encountered various errors with Transmission and/or its Web Portal. Consequently, I can't test my scripts. I'm about 60% confident that they would function as intended.

You may try out the project and see how it performs for you, and becasue this project is built on a Raspberry Pi that allows for easy experimentation with minimal risk â€” thanks to the very fast process of reflashing the SD. 

If you ended up trying the project it worked seamlessly right out of the box or if you had to implement any additional steps to get it working properly for you then please share your your process by emailing me at kumar.prabhas.india@gmail.com. This will help me know whether my project work and should I complete this repo or not.

Due to a currently very busy schedule, I will be postponing further personal testing and development of the project for a few months. I appreciate your understanding and any contributions you can make in the meantime to help improve and validate the project.

Thank you for your interest and support!
